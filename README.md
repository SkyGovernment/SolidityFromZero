# SolidityFromZero
My journey or our journey from zero Solidity to one day deploy a smartcontract in a Blockchain.

## First Tutorial
It all started with a tutorial video and a playlist from YouTube
1. [Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course â€“ Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ) by freeCodeCamp.org
2. [Learn Solidity basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvfQp12V0hS2PQd9-X-E2AjmXj1o05WOo) by HashLips

## Learning Solidity Basic Repository

[Solidity Basics](https://github.com/SkyGovernment/solidity_basics) forked from HashLips

## Where and how to start...

1. Use [Remix by Ethereum](http://remix.ethereum.org/#) IDE
2. Follow through tutorial video while coding and testing
3. Always refer the latest [Official Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/)
